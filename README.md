# TinDog

[TinDog](https://davidjosephind.github.io/TinDog/) is one of the projects I have been working on as part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course.

TinDog is a responsive website that showcases my learnings in the Bootstrap 4 module of the course. It includes implementations of the Bootstrap Navbar, Grid layout, carousel and cards.
