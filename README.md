# TinDog

[TinDog](https://davidjosephind.github.io/TinDog/) is one of the projects I have been working on as part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course. TinDog is a responsive website that showcases my learnings in the Bootstrap 4 module of the course. 

The goal of this project was to understand and implement the Bootstrap framework and advanced CSS in websites.

### The things I learnt to use while creating this project:

- Bootstrap navbar
- The Bootstrap grid layout system
- CSS link order
- Bootstrap containers
- Bootstrap buttons
- Font Awesome images and icons
- Bootstrap Carousel
- Bootstrap cards
- CSS Z-index and stacking order
- Media Query Breakpoints
- Refactoring code
- Combining CSS selectors
- Selector priority in CSS

The end result can be seen below.
